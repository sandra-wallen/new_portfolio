By only using Redux to store the todos of course the todos will not be stored permanently. I quickly decided that I was not satisfied with that, I wanted the application to actually work. Therefor I searched for an existing REST API where I could set up my own database and found restdb that I implemented. When this project was built I had yet not touched on backend and implementing the REST API and the database was very much trial and error, but this taught me alot and I had so much fun doing it!',

I also took the time to rework the frontend a bit, since I had learned alot more at this point and added some fun functionalities such as the emoji picker and hashtags. It was really fun and educating to work on an "old" project and improve it.',
