        ! I'm a junior fullstack developer who has fallen in love with coding and tech. 
        I'm extra passionate about React and I continuously try to dry and reinvent my code throughout my projects. 
        I have always been interested in technologies and I have been a casual PC gamer since I was a 12 years old
